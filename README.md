# SuperReactor
A BetterDiscord plugin that automates super reacting.

## Installation

1. make sure you have: [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)
2. Download the `SuperReactor.plugin.js` file.
3. Place the downloaded file into the `plugins` folder, located within your BetterDiscord installation. You can access this folder via the following steps:
    - Open your Discord settings
    - Go to the "Plugins" tab under "BetterDiscord"
    - Click the "Open Plugins Folder" button
4. Go back to the "Plugins" tab in your Discord settings and enable the "Rainfall" plugin.

(alternatively you can install the fantastic [Plugin Repo](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/PluginRepo/) by DevilBro, and hopefully it'll show up there soon!)

## Usage

Once installed and enabled, the plugin will be automatically activated in your Discord client, simply move your mouse and your reactions will magically superify. You can disable or remove the plugin via the "Plugins" tab in your Discord settings.
